# Accurate-Weather

### Description

For this project, I was able to develop a weather dashboard that runs in the browser and features a dynamically updated HTML and CSS. For the API, I was able to secure it using  [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api).

The weather dashboard will include a 5-day forecast for the city that is searched by the user. Then the current weather will come up and the user can see what the weather forecast is for the current day and the upcoming 5 days. It also displays the date, temperature, wind speed, humidity and an icon to display the weather condition.
